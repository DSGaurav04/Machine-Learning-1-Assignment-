    "1) Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence is the broader field of computer science that aims to create intelligent agents capable of mimicking human-like decision-making and problem-solving. For example, a chatbot that can hold a conversation with a user and provide helpful responses is an application of AI.\n",

Anomaly detection can be achieved using techniques like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation. For example, clustering can group normal data points together, and anomalies will fall into separate or small clusters, making them easier to detect."
